This is a React project for a mock bookstore list app.

## Getting Started

- Clone the [mock back-end repo](https://github.com/squirro/frontend-coding-challenge.git) locally
- `cd` inside `book-store-api` folder and run `npm install`
- Go to `index.js` and modify the `port` field from 3000 to e.g. 4000 to avoid conflict with front-end
- Serve it on the port e.g. 4000 by running `npm run start`

- In another terminal session go to this repo and run `npm install`
- Serve it on the port 3000 by running `npm run dev`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features and Key Functionalities

- Able to display key information such as 
  - bookstore name
  - bookstore image (with round border)
  - book name
  - book author
  - bookstore rating
  - bookstore country
  - bookstore establishment data
  - bookstore website
- Able to go to bookstore website by clicking the hyperlink
- Able to change bookstore rating by hovering and clicking stars
- Able to view on mobile screens of different sizes without layout breaking

## Discussion

- Wireframe is assumably for desktop display. No wireframe for mobile found. So I took liberty in the responsive layout.
