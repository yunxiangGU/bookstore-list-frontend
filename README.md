This is a React project for a mock bookstore list app.

## Getting Started

- Clone the [mock back-end repo](https://github.com/squirro/frontend-coding-challenge.git) locally
- `cd` inside `book-store-api` folder and run `npm install`
- Go to `index.js` and modify the `port` field from 3000 to e.g. 4000 to avoid conflict with front-end
- Serve it on the port e.g. 4000 by running `npm run start`

- In another terminal session go to this repo and run `npm install`
- Serve it on the port 3000 by running `npm run dev`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
